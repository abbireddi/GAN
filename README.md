# GAN
GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of machine learning model consisting of a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates realistic data, while the discriminator evaluates it. Through adversarial training, they improve each other, leading to the generation of high-quality synthetic data.
# How it works 
1.Generator Creation: GAN starts with a generator that generates synthetic data, often images, from random noise.

2.Discriminator Evaluation: Simultaneously, a discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated data by learning from a dataset of actual examples.

3.Adversarial Training: The generator and discriminator engage in a constant feedback loop. The generator aims to produce more convincing data, while the discriminator strives to improve its ability to differentiate between real and generated samples.

4.Optimization: The training process involves optimizing the generator and discriminator iteratively, adjusting their parameters to enhance performance.

5.Equilibrium and Realistic Output: As the generator and discriminator reach equilibrium, the generator produces increasingly realistic data, often indistinguishable from real examples, making GANs powerful tools for generating diverse, high-quality content.
